## Assignment 05: Monte Carlo pi in `C`

In this assignment, you are going to develop a `C` program to compute
pi using a Monte Carlo method.
The program structure is very similar to the Python program you
developed last week and we will provide a template.
The goal is for you to see the difference between a compiled and
interpreted language, both in terms of programming pratices and
performance.

Simply open `pi.c` in your text editor and follow the comments
therein.
